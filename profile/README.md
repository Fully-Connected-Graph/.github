The objectives of the Programming Competition Committee (FSE
standard name), initially a Cover club and now under its official name (FCG) consist of three main foci: (i) Educational, (ii) Competition Organisation, and (iii) Competition Participation.

The committee aims at teaching students diverse programming techniques and expertise through talks and working moments.  If you want to help in the organisation of those events, or get a good introduction to the world of competitive programming, join the committee!
